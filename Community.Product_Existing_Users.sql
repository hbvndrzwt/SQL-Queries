==================================================================================================================
Existing Active User Retention Rate
==================================================================================================================
Definitions
-----------
- Existing User: For the last active day in a given month, the user performed an activity 30-60 days before that day. ( The user was active the month before a given month).
- New Existing User: A user that is an Existing user for the first time. 
- Resurrected Existing User: A user with an activity in a given month, who was a churned user in the previous month.
- Churned User: A user with no activity in a given month and has been Existing user in the past.

Goal
----
We need to understand how many (and which) of the Existing Active Users we can retain.  

Rationale
---------
We need a measure that captures how many of the users that are using Mendix we can retain over time. 
Therefore, this metric excludes 'New Users' for a reason; to eliminate the effect of sudden increases of New Users (who too often do not really use the platform after their signup). 
If we observe a drop in this metric, we need to understand why we are losing users that have previously used Mendix. 

Required splits
---------------
- What type of Existing user a user is in a given month


Required output for PowerBI (Taking into account the splits)
---------------------------
- User data of all Existing Active Users per month
- User data of all Retained Existing Active Users of that month (this means we will miss the last two months of data)
- User intensity of the given month (how many active days the user has) 


Query Plan
---------
1) Retrieve All the active users in a given month
2) Determine their last activity date in a month
3) Check whether their signup date is 30 days before their last activity date
4) Filter out users for who their signup date is not 30 days before their last activity date (so now we only have Existing Active Users)
5) Use the last activity date to set a lowerbound (+30 days) and upperbound (+60 days)
6) Based on the lower- and upperbound, check whether the users show any activity during that time period (if yes, this is a retained user)
7) ...
