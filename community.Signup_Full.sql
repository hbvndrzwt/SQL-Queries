-- Goal of this query is to create an aggregated table (day) which contains all conversions metrics for the SignupForm (which can be aggregated by day). It is also grouped by Experiment & ExperimentGroup 

-- TO_DO: -INVITES SHOULD BE AN AVERAGE OF TOTAL SIGNUPS
		  -- IF SignupDate is not Empty (thus a user does a Signup) --> Check if SignupDate & FirstSignupPageVisit are close to each other 
		  -- Should Users be grouped by CookieId or CookieId & Date"?? --> So Unique Visitors per Day (instead of Unique Visitors overall)
