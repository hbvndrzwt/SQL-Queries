Columns needed: 

ProjectId (Unique): Get it from 'TemplateBrowserProjectCreationSucceeded' event, which is triggered when a user creates a new project from the Template Browser
OpenId: Unique ID for the user who creates the Project
Name (Starter) App: Use Template UUID from the 'TemplateBrowserProjectCreationSucceeded' event. Still need to link this to Template data gathered from the app (OData)
Timestamp Project Creation succeeded
Timestamp First Deploy (if available)
TimeDiff
#Users in the project (so far)
#Deploys made on the project (so far)
*/

/*
Need to do:
- Add Userinfo (exclude Mendix) - DONE
- Add Number of Project Created (first app, second, etc..) 
- Retrieve Template data from the app - IS IN ODATA CONNECTION IN POWER BI
